/// You must keep your components as long as you want them to send/receive events.
/// Common practice is to store `Component`s in the `Widget` struct (see the [communication
/// example](https://github.com/antoyo/relm/blob/master/examples/communication.rs#L182-L188)).
/// The `#[widget]` attribute takes care of storing them in the struct automatically (see the
/// [communication-attribute example](https://github.com/antoyo/relm/blob/master/examples/communication-attribute.rs)).
